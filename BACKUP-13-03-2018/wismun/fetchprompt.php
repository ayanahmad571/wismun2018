<h2>Security Council</h2>

<strong>MOTION 1:</strong> Nuclear non-proliferation in the 21st Century. 
<br>

<strong>PROMPT FOR MOTION 1:</strong> The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is a landmark international treaty whose objective is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons technology, and to promote cooperation and knowledge on how we can achieve peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The treaty has established a safeguard system under the responsibility of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is an organisation that conducts inspections of the Treaty and what goes on in accordance with it. The treaty promotes cooperation in this powerful field of nuclear technology, whilst also preventing the diversion of fissile material for the use of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). Countries such as Iran and more recently, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea are examples of countries that the rest of the world is cautious about when concerned with the topic of nuclear weapons. However, following recent threats and speculation of certain countries willing to use WMDs as a means to achieve national interests, the Security Council must come to a renewed agreement to make nuclear proliferation a prohibitive task to achieve.

<strong>MOTION 2:</strong> Reviewing the International Community’s intervention in the MENA Region
<br>

<strong>PROMPT FOR MOTION 2:</strong> Much of the international community finds itself entwined in the complex conflicts of the MENA region, making it imperative that international intervention in these conflicts be reviewed and streamlined with broadly agreed common goals established. While ISIS territory has been greatly reduced as a consequence of the international coalition at work since 2014, its global threat remains far from extinct as it continues to hold territory in several other nations such as Libya, Afghanistan, the Philippines and much of Africa. Solutions must be agreed upon as to what the international community can do wipe out remaining fragments of ISIS while considering other factors and the repercussions to global security. Delegates are urged to widen the scope of discussion to include considerations of the situation in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen and Qatar. The need for our SC delegates to review the international community’s intervention in the MENA region is particularly pertinent as the decades of conflict plaguing the region have distorted its governance, and thus, key national identity beyond measure. The review process will thus enable discussion on judicious military intervention in the region being complemented by internationally-aided political restoration to rebuild the loss of domestic identity in the face of conflict.

<h2>Human RIghts Council (HRC)</h2>

<strong>MOTION 1:</strong> The balancing of cybersecurity between states and individuals. 
<br>

<strong>PROMPT FOR MOTION 1:</strong> Balancing cybersecurity and determining to what extent it is both ethical, and efficient to interfere with each individual’s online information differs from state to state. “Cyber warfare” is not seen to be a technical legal term, and it has been argued by some to be even misleading and unhelpful. This is because there is a concern that the term may glorify those criminals that responsible for malicious actions in the cyber domain, and therefore exaggerate the threat. In 2003, the Secretary General of the UN set up a High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, to examine global peace and security issues, identify how collective security may address these threats, and recommend changes that may be required. Issues such as the United States wiretapping and snooping on Angela Merkel are advances that are deemed to be unethical, however is being ethical more important than what a leader believes is correct for a nation and its individuals? Resolution 59, adopted in 1946 by the UN, states that "Freedom of information is a fundamental human right and… (is)... the touchstone of all the freedoms to which the UN consecrated". Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that: “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes the right to hold opinions…”. These resolutions and articles are significant in what has already been done to ensure freedom of speech, however due to these resolutions being written decades ago, do delegates believe that they still apply in accordance with cybersecurity?

<strong>MOTION 2:</strong> The conditions and living standards of incarcerated convicts.
<br>

<strong>PROMPT FOR MOTION 2:</strong> Shielded from public view, prisons tend to remain hidden sites of human rights abuse. By struggling against this natural tendency toward secrecy and silence, the efforts of local human rights groups and those of national governments -- who fight to obtain access to prisons, monitor prison conditions, and publicize the abuses they find -- are critical. In South Africa the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has conducted numerous investigations into prison conditions, resulting in substantial public criticism of prison authorities.
At the regional level as well, prison monitoring mechanisms are active. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the most prominent of these bodies, inspected penal institutions in eleven countries in 1997, including those of Turkey, Spain, and Estonia. In December 1996, the CPT released a public statement on Turkey, declaring that "resort to torture and other forms of severe ill-treatment remains a common occurrence in police establishments in Turkey."
Delegates must keep in mind that while such prison monitoring mechanisms may be active, the extent to which they are able to improve conditions is often fairly limited, making collaboration between governments and non-state actors an important consideration. The globalisation of supermax prisons (conceived originally in the United States) is an interesting phenomenon to research and consider in line with our theme.

<h2>United Nations Economic and Social Organisation (ECOSOC)</h2>

<strong>MOTION 1:</strong> Boosting economic activity in Africa to stimulate domestic employment opportunities. 
<br>

<strong>PROMPT FOR MOTION 1:</strong> Employment is central to reducing poverty, achieving the Millennium Development Goals and fostering equitable, inclusive and sustainable development. However, many African economies are simply not generating sufficient decent work opportunities to reduce poverty. Young people are facing particularly poor opportunities; with not enough jobs are being created to absorb new entrants to the workforce, which can contribute to social exclusion, political instability and conflict. Whilst the international community may believe that by providing aid they may be helping the African continent, it is still in question whether the nature of the aid being provided is what the countries and economies are in need of. It is vital to assess and evaluate the nature of aid when trying to improve the employment opportunities in Africa, along with a consideration of the merits of direct investment into the country as opposed to providing aid. 
A stimulation of economic activity in Africa through means such as FDIs would be the first step in reducing the growing immigration levels to Europe- this “brain drain” must be stopped to allow the African continent to flourish and develop. The role of the international community in this sense is to allow Africa to develop, and not to unwittingly stall their development by spoon feeding them in any manner.

<strong>MOTION 2:</strong> Supporting underserved markets to recover from natural disasters and conflict.
<br>

<strong>PROMPT FOR MOTION 2:</strong> Underserved markets are ones that are sizable and where there are few providers who are delivering solutions to that market’s set of known and latent problems. This often results in a monopoly which has no incentive to innovate or update its existing products to better fit the market’s actual needs. The problem becomes all the more serious in the face of conflict and/or natural disasters, further limiting the ability of the already underprovided market to satisfy the needs and wants of its consumers. Delegates need to identify and consider how the issue of underserved markets in themselves may be tackled, and subsequently widen the discussion to address the social and economic implications of conflict and natural disasters for these markets and how they may be resolved. The role of technology sharing in overcoming this common issue is a possible route to resolution.

<h2>United Nations Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organisation (UNESCO)</h2>

<strong>MOTION 1:</strong> Education as a catalyst for sustainable human development in developing countries. 
<br>

<strong>PROMPT FOR MOTION 1:</strong> Education is important for every aspect of national development. Education is a right for every child, however in many developing countries, it is hardly a viable option. The delegates must come up with solutions and resolutions as to how, by using education as a catalyst, developing countries can witness and undergo sustainable human development. Human development may be in the form of the economy, health, or just intellect itself. Education is one aspect that opens the windows to all these other sectors, and is therefore essential to everyone.
<br>
It would be sensible for delegates to have a good understanding of the Human Development Index (HDI) and how it links to economic indicators for development like Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

<strong>MOTION 2:</strong> Preserving local dialects and languages as a means of diversifying global cultures.
<br>

<strong>PROMPT FOR MOTION 2:</strong> : Languages, with their complex implications for identity, communication, social integration, education and development, are of strategic importance to people and the planet. Yet, due to globalisation processes, they are increasingly under threat, or disappearing altogether. Many UN bodies are making conscious efforts towards the preservation of such languages through training sessions conducted in indigenous languages as well as through the translation of key documents into these languages. However, in order to offset the singularity of identity that globalisation infamously brings about, international action in the preservation of local dialects and languages is imperative as a means of diversifying global cultures and safeguarding the cultural identities of indigenous and minority peoples.
